C Programming Language

C is a general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. 
It has influenced many modern programming languages, including C++, C#, Java, and Python. 
C is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, operating systems, and application development due to its efficiency and close-to-hardware capabilities.

Basic Concepts of C

1. Variables and Data Types:
   Variables are named storage locations that hold data. 
   C supports various data types including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more complex types.

2. Operators:
   C provides operators for arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operations. 
   These operators allow manipulation of data values during program execution.

3. Control Structures:
   C supports conditional statements and loops. 
   Conditional statements allow decisions to be made based on conditions. 
   Loops provide mechanisms to execute code repeatedly until certain conditions are met.

4. Functions:
   Functions allow modularization of code, breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable units. 
   Functions can take parameters and return values, enhancing reusability and readability.

5. Arrays:
   Arrays are collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. 
   They allow storage and manipulation of multiple values under a single identifier.

6. Pointers:
   Pointers store memory addresses of variables and provide powerful capabilities for memory management, dynamic data structures, and efficient program execution.

7. Structures:
   Structures allow grouping of variables of different types under a single name. 
   They are useful for modeling real-world entities and managing related data together.

8. Unions:
   Unions are similar to structures but share the same memory location among all members. 
   Only one member can contain a valid value at any given time.

9. File Handling:
   File handling in C enables permanent storage and retrieval of data. 
   Common operations include creating, reading, writing, appending, and closing files. 
   Proper error handling ensures reliable file operations.
